## Introduction

This repository exists to support the Firemacs Github organization. The purpose of the Firemacs Github organization is to support Firemacs. The motivation for creating a Firemacs organization is to transition Firemacs to Mozilla's Webextensions (Electrolyis/e10s) technology before 2018 when Firefox 57 is released without support for the legacy API's Firemacs depends upon.

The original author of Firemacs is Kazu YAMAMOTO

The original README is contained in the file legacy_readme.
